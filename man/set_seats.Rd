\arguments{
\item{x}{the specification to be modified, object of class \code{"JD3_TRAMOSEATS_SPEC"}, has to be generated with \code{tramoseats_spec()} function}

\item{approximation}{character: the approximation mode.
When the ARIMA model estimated by TRAMO does not accept an admissible
decomposition, SEATS:
\code{"None"} - performs an approximation;
\code{"Legacy"} - replaces the model with a decomposable one;
\code{"Noisy"} - estimates a new model by adding a white noise to the
non-admissible model estimated by TRAMO. Default="Legacy".}

\item{trend.boundary}{numeric: the trend boundary (rmod). The boundary beyond
which an AR root is integrated in the trend component.
If the modulus of the inverse real root is greater than the trend boundary,
the AR root is integrated in the trend component.
Below this value, the root is integrated in the transitory component.
Possible values [0,1]. Default = 0.5.}

\item{seas.boundary}{numeric: the seasonal boundary (sbound). The boundary
beyond which a real negative AR root is integrated in the seasonal component.
If the modulus of the inverse negative real root is greater (or equal) than
Seasonal boundary, the AR root is integrated into the seasonal component.
Otherwise the root is integrated into the trend or transitory component.
Possible values [0,1]. Default=0.8.}

\item{seas.boundary.unique}{numeric: the seasonal boundary (unique),
(sboundatpi).
The boundary beyond which a negative AR root is integrated in the seasonal
component, when the root is the unique seasonal root.  If the modulus of the
inverse negative real root is greater (or equal) than Seasonal boundary, the
AR root is integrated into the seasonal component. Otherwise the root is
integrated into the trend or transitory component. Possible values [0,1].
Default=0.8.}

\item{seas.tolerance}{numeric: the seasonal tolerance (epsphi). The tolerance
(measured in degrees) to allocate the AR non-real roots to the seasonal
component (if the modulus of the inverse complex AR root is greater than the
trend boundary and the frequency of this root differs from one of the
seasonal frequencies by less than Seasonal tolerance) or the transitory
component (otherwise). Possible values in [0,10]. Default value 2.}

\item{ma.boundary}{numeric: the MA unit root boundary. When the modulus of an
estimated MA root falls in the range [xl, 1], it is set to xl. Possible
values [0.9,1]. Default=0.95.}

\item{bcasts, fcasts}{numeric: the number of backasts (\code{bcasts}) or forecasts
(\code{fcasts}) used in the decomposition in periods (positive values) or years
(negative values). Default \code{bcasts} = 0. Default \code{fcasts} = 0.}

\item{algorithm}{character: the estimation method for the unobserved
components. The choice can be made from:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Burman"}: the default value. May result in a significant underestimation
of the components' standard deviation, as it may become numerically unstable
when some roots of the MA polynomial are near 1;
\item \code{"KalmanSmoother"}: it is not disturbed by the (quasi-) unit roots in MA;
}}

\item{bias}{TODO.}
